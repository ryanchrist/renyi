Description: renyi implements the Renyi Outlier Test <arXiv:2411.13542>, 
    an outlier test designed for modern large scale testing applications, especially where prior information available.
    The test combines a vector of independent uniform p-values into one p-value with power 
    against alternatives where a small number of p-values are non-null.
    The test can leverage prior probabilities/weights specifying which variables are likely to be outliers 
    and prior estimates of effect size. The procedure is fast even when the number 
    of initial p-values is large (e.g. in the millions) and numerically stable even for very small p-values (e.g. 10^-300).
